Visual Identity & Theme:

Theme: High-end Consulting Aesthetic. Use a Clean White Theme (Background: #FFFFFF or #F9FAFB).

Typography: Use professional, high-legibility sans-serif fonts. Use Inter for body text and Playfair Display or Roboto Mono for headers and data points to give it a "Financial Times" or "The Economist" feel.

Color Palette: Professional Slate (#1E293B), Crisp White, and accents of "Policy Blue" (#2563EB). Use soft shadows and subtle borders instead of dark glows.

Watermark: Add a sophisticated, low-opacity footer that reads: "Engineered by Ritu Ann Roy | ParityPulse Framework v1.0".

Core New Features:

Labour-Time Exchange Metric: Replace simple currency costs with a "Work-Hour Index." Fetch average hourly wage data (via World Bank/ILO API or static high-quality dataset) and calculate how many hours a citizen in the selected country must work to afford the user's input basket.

Macro-Policy Simulation Slider: Add a sidebar slider labeled "Global Tariff Adjustment." When toggled, it should mathematically simulate the impact of trade barriers on the "Parity Score" across the map.

Interactive Mapbox Globe: Use a Light-themed Mapbox style (mapbox://styles/mapbox/light-v11). When a user hovers over a country, display a clean "Executive Summary" tooltip showing the Work-Hour Index and a "Resilience Rating."

AI Strategic Briefing: Add a section at the bottom titled "Advisory Insights." Use an LLM to generate a 3-point strategic summary of the current map data, focusing on "Socioeconomic Risks" and "Market Opportunities."

Technical Workflow:

Input: Simple user list (e.g., "Monthly Rent, 50L Gasoline, 10kg Coffee").

Processing: Calculate the ParityPulse Index: (Local Basket Cost / Local Wage) / (Home Basket Cost / Home Wage).

Backend: Python/FastAPI for economic calculations; Replit PostgreSQL for caching wage data.

Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS. Ensure all components use a "Minimalist Professional" design—no "hacker" neon or dark backgrounds.
