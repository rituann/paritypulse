The "ParityPulse" engine doesn't just pull random numbers from a hat. It uses dynamic reasoning to apply a set of high-quality economic benchmarks.Here is the breakdown of how the AI "knows" what to do:1. The "Base" Dataset (The Foundation)I prompted the Replit Agent to use established, "set" values for the core economic data.World Bank & ILO Benchmarks: The AI uses real-world data points for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and Average Hourly Wages as its "ground truth".Manama Reference: For your specific base, it uses the 2026 benchmarks we discussed (e.g., ~1,850 BHD for professional wages) to set the "1.0x Parity" line.2. The "Dynamic Reasoning" (The AI Brain)When you move the tariff slider or add new items, the AI switches into "Dynamic Simulation" mode.It calculates "Policy Shocks": Instead of having a table that says "What happens at 10% tariff," the AI thinks through the impact. It knows that if a country like Singapore has a high Import Dependency, a tariff hike must mathematically hit it harder than a country with massive local production.Real-Time Indexing: Every time you change an input, the backend reruns a Regression Model. It calculates:$$New Index = \frac{Calculated Local Price + (Tariff Impact \times Import Dependency)}{Local Wage}$$This is "dynamic" because it's generating new data points that didn't exist until you moved the slider.3. "Vibe Coding" the LogicIn the prompt I gave your Replit Agent, I used a technique called "Agentic Programming":I didn't just give it a CSV file; I gave it instructions on how to be an economist.I told it: "If the user increases tariffs, identify countries with low trade resilience and shift their parity color toward red proportionately".This allows the app to feel like it's "thinking" because it's applying economic rules to static data to create a dynamic outcome.Summary: Why it looks so "Smart"FeatureStatic Part (The Set)Dynamic Part (The Thinking)LocationCoordinates of ManamaRecalculating distances & arcsPricesBase cost of a basketMultiplying by tariff/inflation curvesStatusWage benchmarksDetermining "Value" vs "Premium" in real-time
